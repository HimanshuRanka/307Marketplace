## Project Description
The Project is building a cross platform Online Marketplace.

## Project Requirements:

1. Control panel that allows users to list products to sell. A listed product should include at least a photo, a name, a description, a price and an inventory count. Users should be able to add, update and delete product listings.

2. Allow users to browse products, add products to cart, view total price of the cart, input shipping address, and finish check out. Upon check out, product inventory count must be updated, and users must not be allowed to purchase items that are out of stock.

3. Users should be able to see their order history, which includes the products that have been purchased.

4. Use WebSocket to allow buyers to chat with sellers in real time. Itâ€™s up to you how you want to implement this. One approach is to have a chat room for each seller, which anyone can join.
